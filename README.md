# A C compiler project, currently just an assembler
As of right now, I've got to a point where the only unfinished part is the actual encoding. I've been looking for an elegant way to do this, to little avail.
I will be leaving this project for now because I've been working on it for a while. It's not far from finished but also needs to be cleaned up and refactors
This is the most successful of my attempts to create an assembler, and it is essentially functioning but not for all operand types. Directives and compile-time algebra are missing
